# WT-Project-2024
Milan Technical University's Web Technologies project.

This project involves the development of a web application using HTML, Java, and JavaScript, with Apache Tomcat as the web server. The application serves as a simple File Manager, allowing users to log in, create folders, and create documents, all of which are stored in an SQL database.
